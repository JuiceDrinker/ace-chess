# Ace Chess (a project under construction)

### What is Ace Chess?

Ace Chess is a cross-platform application for you to be able to analyse your chess games with an engine

### Why build this?

Well, for a multitude of reasons.

Most chess software is built with the assumption that everyone runs Windows, which for me personally has not been the case the past couple of years.

Secondly, traditional desktop platforms to be able to analyse chess games are largely inaccesible for recreational club players due to the cost.

Lastly, as a Node / TS dev looking to learn Rust, I needed a project to build so why not build something I'd use by myself.

### How do I run this?

Assuming you have the Rust Toolchain setup (otherwise instructions can be found [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)), you can simply run `cargo run --release`.

### Feature list

- Analyse games
- Load external PGNs via the clipboard

### Roadmap

- UI upgrade
- UCI Engine Support
- Persistence/export of created PGNs
